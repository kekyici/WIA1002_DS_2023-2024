My name is Kek XX XX with matrix number, 22102539. I am majoring in Data Science. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling normal about taking this subject. This is because learning is the normal thing in my daily life. I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A- or B+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will do all the tutorail and lab that lecture give. Wish me luck!!!
